description: This command checks some template rule/commands/skill to update them if needed.
mode: Code
---


You are a reviewer for .roo rules/commands/skill that were imported from another repository. Your goal is to compare the new templates and see if there are missing fields or anything new to be added to the files.

## Steps
For each files in ./roo_template, **including dotfiles such as `.roomodes`**
    1. Read the file
    2. Work out where it belongs. `./roo_template/.roomodes` belongs at the repository root as `./.roomodes`; everything else mirrors its path under `./.roo` (so `./roo_template/rules-docs-manager/guidelines.xml` becomes `./.roo/rules-docs-manager/guidelines.xml`).
    3. If the destination does not exist, create it with the structure and content from the template.
    4. If it exists, add the new content to it.
    5. When you are done, you can delete ./roo_template
    6. Make a quick recap of what was added, and tell the user how to add new stuffs

### Merging `.roomodes`
`.roomodes` is a YAML list, not prose, so merge it by entry rather than by section:
    1. If `./.roomodes` is absent, copy the template across.
    2. If it exists, append only the modes whose `slug` is not already present under `customModes`. Never overwrite a mode the user already has.
    3. A mode's `groups` entry carries a `fileRegex` that decides which files the mode may edit. Ask the user which paths apply in this repository before writing it, and keep the pattern as narrow as their answer allows.

## What this command cannot update
`.roo/mcp.json` lives **outside** `./roo_template`, so it is not covered by the steps
above. It is owned by `./anvil setup-repo`, which is therefore the only way to add or
change an Anvil-managed MCP server entry. Re-running `setup-repo` **merges** the file
rather than rewriting it: servers you added by hand are preserved untouched, the
servers Anvil owns are refreshed, and nothing is ever removed.

This matters for the **oxylabs** documentation-fetching server: if the rules delivered by
this command tell a mode to fetch documentation with oxylabs but `.roo/mcp.json` has no
`oxylabs` entry, the tool will simply be absent. Re-run
`./anvil setup-repo /path/to/this/repo` from the Anvil directory to pick it up, and supply
credentials when prompted. Existing `.env` values are reused and existing keys are
preserved.

## Guidelines
- Always change placeholders when adding a new sections from a template. (placeholders are usually under <>) Do not copy <...> into the .md files in the .roo.
- Always write based on facts, if a placeholder (<>) needs to add new information in the file, either refer to the repository or the user.
- Don't overwhelm the user with multiple questions at once, ask one question, get the answer and update the file, then go to the next one.
- Follow each steps, don't try to do everything at once.
- Explain what you are doing to the user and why. e.g. copy the "command" "X" to your repository to ... or "updating ..."
- When requesting the user, it should be clear but concise, it is important to clearly communicate the intentions in the documents.
